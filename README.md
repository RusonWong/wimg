#zimg#


zimg is a light image storage and processing system. It's written by C and it has high performance in image field. There is a benchmark test report with more infomation: [Benchmark](http://zimg.buaa.us/benchmark.html). zimg is designed for high concurrency image server. It supports many features for uploading and downloading images.

### Versions:
- 06/10/2014 - zimg 2.2.0 Release. Fixed memory leak in imagemagick.
- 05/18/2014 - zimg 2.1.0 Release. Added IP access control module.
- 04/26/2014 - zimg 2.0.0 Release. Supported distributed storage backends.
- 03/10/2014 - zimg 1.1.0 Release. Supported SSDB storage.
- 08/01/2013 - zimg 1.0.0 Release.

### Dependence:
> We stand on the shoulders of giants.  

[libevent](https://github.com/libevent/libevent): Provides a sophisticated framework for buffered network IO.  
[imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/magick-wand.php): A software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images.  
[libmemcached](https://github.com/trondn/libmemcached): LibMemcached is designed to provide the greatest number of options to use Memcached.  
[lua](http://www.lua.org/): Lua is a lightweight multi-paradigm programming language designed as a scripting language with extensible semantics as a primary goal.  
#### [Optional] For Storage:  
[memcached](https://github.com/memcached/memcached): A distributed memory object caching system.  
[beansdb](https://github.com/douban/beansdb): Beansdb is a distributed key-value storage system designed for large scale online system, aiming for high avaliablility and easy management.  
[beanseye](https://github.com/douban/beanseye): Beanseye is proxy and monitor for beansdb, written in Go.  
[SSDB](https://github.com/ideawu/ssdb): SSDB is a high performace key-value(key-string, key-zset, key-hashmap) NoSQL database, an alternative to Redis.  
[twemproxy](https://github.com/twitter/twemproxy): Twemproxy is a fast and lightweight proxy for memcached and redis protocol.  

#### Thanks to:  
> zimg contains libevhtp and libhiredis. You needn't install them now.

[libevhtp](https://github.com/ellzey/libevhtp): A more flexible replacement for libevent's httpd API.  
[hiredis](https://github.com/redis/hiredis): Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database.  

### Supplying:
Receive and storage users' upload images.  
Transfer image through HTTP protocol.  
Process resized and grayed image by request parameter.  
Use memcached to improve performance.  
Multi-thread support for multi-core processor server.  
Use lua for conf and other functions.  
**Support beansdb/SSDB mode to save images into distributed storage backends.**  
IP access control for uploading and downloading images.  

### In Planning:
Performance optimization.  
Security measures.  

### Documentation:
There is an architecture design document of zimg v1.0. It is written in Chinese.  
[Architecture Design of zimg](http://zimg.buaa.us/arch_design.html)  
And this document is to introduce zimg v2.0.  
[Distributed Image Storage Server: zimg](http://blog.buaa.us/?p=215)
